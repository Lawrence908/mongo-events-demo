| **events** | `title, description, category, tags` | Text | Full-text search with relevance scoring | High | Primary search functionality across multiple fields |
| **events** | `startDate` | Single field | Date range queries and chronological sorting | High | Most common filter for upcoming events |
| **events** | `category, startDate` | Compound | Category + date filtering | High | Common user filter combination |
| **events** | `eventType, startDate` | Compound | Polymorphic event type filtering | High | Filter by event type (virtual, hybrid, etc.) |
| **events** | `venueReference.venueType, startDate` | Compound | Extended reference pattern optimization | Medium | Venue type filtering without joins |
| **venues** | `location` | 2dsphere | Geospatial venue discovery | High | Find venues near location |
| **venues** | `venueType, capacity` | Compound | Polymorphic venue filtering | Medium | Filter venues by type and capacity |
| **reviews** | `eventId, rating` | Compound | Event rating aggregations | High | Calculate average ratings per event |
| **checkins** | `eventId, userId` | Compound (Unique) | Prevent duplicate check-ins | High | Data integrity constraint |

### Detailed Index Analysis

#### 1. Geospatial Indexes (2dsphere)

**Events Collection - Location Index**
- **Query Pattern**: Find events within X km of user location
- **Frequency**: Very High (primary discovery feature)
- **Performance Impact**: O(log n) - Excellent for large datasets
- **Example Query**:
  ```javascript
  db.events.aggregate([
    {
      $geoNear: {
        near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-74.0060, 40.7128] },
        distanceField: "distance",
        maxDistance: 50000,
        spherical: true
      }
    }
  ])
  ```

#### 2. Text Search Indexes

**Events Collection - Multi-field Text Index**
- **Query Pattern**: Full-text search across title, description, category, and tags
- **Frequency**: Very High (primary search functionality)
- **Performance Impact**: O(log n) with relevance scoring
- **Weighted Fields**: title(10), category(5), tags(3), description(1)

#### 3. Compound Indexes for Common Query Patterns

**Category + Date Filtering**
- **Query Pattern**: "Technology events this weekend"
- **Frequency**: Very High (most common user filter)
- **Index**: `{category: 1, startDate: 1}`
- **Performance**: Single index scan, very efficient

**Geospatial + Date Filtering**
- **Query Pattern**: "Events near me next month"
- **Frequency**: High (location + time filtering)
- **Index**: `{location: "2dsphere", startDate: 1}`
- **Performance**: Single index scan with geospatial optimization

#### 4. Polymorphic Indexes

**Event Type Filtering**
- **Query Pattern**: Filter by event type (virtual, hybrid, in-person, recurring)
- **Frequency**: High (event type is a primary discriminator)
- **Indexes**: 
  - `{eventType: 1, startDate: 1}` - Type + date filtering
  - `{eventType: 1, category: 1}` - Type + category filtering

#### 5. Extended Reference Pattern Indexes

**Venue Reference Optimization**
- **Query Pattern**: Filter events by venue type or city without joins
- **Frequency**: Medium (venue-based filtering)
- **Indexes**:
  - `{venueReference.venueType: 1, startDate: 1}` - Venue type + date
  - `{venueReference.city: 1, startDate: 1}` - City + date
  - `{venueReference.capacity: 1}` - Capacity sorting

## Design Patterns Used & Anti-Patterns Avoided

### Design Patterns Used

#### 1. Extended Reference Pattern

**Implementation**: Events store denormalized venue data for performance optimization.

```javascript
// Event document with extended venue reference
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "title": "Tech Conference 2024",
  "venueId": ObjectId("venue123"),
  "venueReference": {
    "name": "Convention Center",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "capacity": 5000,
    "venueType": "conferenceCenter"
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Query Performance: Avoid joins when filtering events by venue type or city
- Reduced Lookups: Venue information available in event queries without additional database calls
- Filtering Capability: Enable venue-based filtering without expensive joins

#### 2. Computed Pattern

**Implementation**: Pre-calculated statistics stored in documents to improve query performance.

```javascript
// Event with computed statistics
{
  "computedStats": {
    "totalTicketsSold": 180,
    "totalRevenue": 45000,
    "attendanceRate": 75.0,
    "reviewCount": 23,
    "averageRating": 4.2,
    "lastUpdated": ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z")
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Performance: Eliminates expensive aggregations for dashboard queries
- Consistency: Single source of truth for statistics
- Scalability: Reduces database load during peak usage

#### 3. Polymorphic Pattern

**Implementation**: Single collection with type-specific fields for different entity types.

```javascript
// Virtual event
{
  "eventType": "virtual",
  "virtualDetails": {
    "platform": "Zoom",
    "meetingUrl": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789",
    "recordingAvailable": true,
    "timezone": "PST"
  }
}

// Hybrid event
{
  "eventType": "hybrid",
  "hybridDetails": {
    "virtualCapacity": 500,
    "inPersonCapacity": 100,
    "virtualMeetingUrl": "https://teams.microsoft.com/j/987654321"
  }
}
```

#### 4. Schema Versioning Pattern

**Implementation**: All collections include `schemaVersion` field for future evolution.

```javascript
// All documents include schema version
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 5. Bridge Collection Pattern

**Implementation**: `checkins` collection serves as bridge for many-to-many relationship between users and events.

### Anti-Patterns Avoided

#### 1. Over-Embedding Large Subdocuments

**What We Avoided**: Storing large, frequently changing data as embedded documents.

**Why We Avoided It**:
- Document Size Limit: MongoDB has 16MB document size limit
- Write Performance: Updating user document becomes expensive
- Memory Usage: Large documents consume excessive RAM

**Our Solution**: Separate `reviews` collection with references.

#### 2. Over-Indexing (Too Many Indexes Slowing Down Writes)

**What We Avoided**: Creating indexes for every possible query without considering write performance.

**Why We Avoided It**:
- Write Performance: Each index slows down insert/update operations
- Storage Overhead: Excessive index storage requirements
- Memory Usage: Too many indexes consume excessive RAM

**Our Solution**: Strategic compound indexes that support multiple query patterns.

#### 3. Missing Indexes on Frequent Queries

**What We Avoided**: Not creating indexes for commonly executed queries.

**Our Solution**: Comprehensive indexing strategy with compound indexes for common query patterns.

#### 4. Using Regex Without Index Support

**What We Avoided**: Using regular expressions on unindexed fields.

**Our Solution**: Text indexes for full-text search with relevance scoring.

#### 5. Inefficient Pagination

**What We Avoided**: Using offset-based pagination for large datasets.

**Our Solution**: Cursor-based pagination with compound indexes.

## Relationship & Schema Diagrams

### Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

The ER diagram shows the logical relationships between entities in the EventSphere system:

- **Users** can write multiple **Reviews** for events or venues
- **Users** can check into multiple **Events** (many-to-many via **Checkins**)
- **Events** can be hosted at **Venues** (one-to-many)
- **Events** can receive multiple **Reviews**
- **Venues** can host multiple **Events**

**Key Relationships**:
- 1:Many - Venue:Events (reference from events.venueId)
- Many:Many - Users:Events via checkins bridge
- 1:Many - User:Reviews (user can write multiple reviews)
- 1:Many - Event:Reviews (event can receive multiple reviews)

### MongoDB Collection Relationship Diagram

The collection diagram shows the actual MongoDB implementation with embedding and referencing decisions:

**Embedded Documents**:
- `tickets[]` in events - Always displayed together
- `attendees[]` in events - Quick RSVP display
- `address` in venues - Always needed with venue info
- `computedStats` in events and venues - Pre-calculated for performance

**Referenced Documents**:
- `venueId` in events - Venues shared across multiple events
- `userId` in checkins - Users referenced across many events
- `eventId` in checkins - Events referenced by many check-ins

**Bridge Collection**:
- `checkins` collection serves as bridge for many-to-many user↔event relationship
- Denormalized `venueId` for analytics performance
- Unique constraint on `{eventId: 1, userId: 1}` to prevent duplicates

## GridFS and GeoJSON Implementation

### GeoJSON Implementation

EventSphere extensively uses GeoJSON for geospatial data storage and queries:

#### GeoJSON Point Storage
```javascript
// Event location
{
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-123.93446771957665, 49.10036536726016]
  }
}

// User preference location
{
  "profile": {
    "preferences": {
      "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-80.48434831242973, 43.52343446108092]
      },
      "radiusKm": 38
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2dsphere Index Support
```javascript
// Geospatial index for events
db.events.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })

// Geospatial index for venues
db.venues.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
```

#### Geospatial Queries
```javascript
// Find events within 50km of NYC
db.events.aggregate([
  {
    $geoNear: {
      near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [-74.0060, 40.7128] },
      distanceField: "distance",
      maxDistance: 50000,
      spherical: true
    }
  }
])
```

**Benefits of GeoJSON Implementation**:
- Native MongoDB support for geospatial queries
- Efficient radius-based event discovery
- Integration with mapping libraries
- Support for complex geospatial analytics

### GridFS Consideration

While EventSphere doesn't currently implement GridFS, the system is designed to support it for future file storage needs:

**Potential GridFS Use Cases**:
- Event images and promotional materials
- User profile pictures
- Event documents and handouts
- QR code images for check-ins

**GridFS Schema Design**:
```javascript
// fs.files collection metadata
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "filename": "event_poster_123.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg",
  "metadata": {
    "eventId": ObjectId("event123"),
    "uploadedBy": ObjectId("user456"),
    "category": "event_poster",
    "isPublic": true,
    "uploadDate": ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z")
  },
  "length": 245760,
  "chunkSize": 261120,
  "uploadDate": ISODate("2024-01-15T10:30:00Z")
}
```

**GridFS Indexes**:
```javascript
// Indexes for GridFS metadata queries
db.fs.files.createIndex({ "metadata.eventId": 1 })
db.fs.files.createIndex({ "metadata.uploadedBy": 1 })
db.fs.files.createIndex({ "metadata.category": 1 })
db.fs.files.createIndex({ "uploadDate": 1 })
```
